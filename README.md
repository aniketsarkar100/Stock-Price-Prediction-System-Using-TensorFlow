# Stock-Price-Prediction-System-Using-TensorFlow
This project is a Stock Market Price Prediction System built using TensorFlow and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Historical stock data is collected via the Yahoo Finance API, preprocessed, and used to train the LSTM model for predicting future stock prices. The model specifically focuses on time series forecasting of closing prices. Data is normalized, split into training and testing sets, and predictions are visualized with Matplotlib for clear analysis. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning, sequential modeling, and financial data forecasting using TensorFlow and can be extended to other stocks or financial instruments. It provides a solid foundation for applying machine learning in financial markets.
